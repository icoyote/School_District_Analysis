# Election Results analysis with Python #

## Overview of the school district analysis: ##

For this project we received 2 files containing high school data. The first file had a list of high schools with their budget and the second file had a listing of students belonging to the high schools and their math and reading grades.

During the review of the content of the files while applying data frame functionalities, it was found that some names in the **students_complete.csv** needed to be cleaned by removing Preffixes and some incorrect Suffixes founf within the student's names.

Also by merging both files and we will obtain a high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics:

- Total number of students

- Total number of schools

# School District analysis with Python #

## Overview of the school district analysis: ##

For this project we received 2 files containing high school data. The first file had a list of high schools with their budget and the second file had a listing of students belonging to the high schools and their math and reading grades.

During the review of the content of the files while applying data frame functionalities, it was found that some names in the **students_complete.csv** needed to be cleaned by removing Preffixes and some incorrect Suffixes founf within the student's names.

Also by merging both files and we will obtain a high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics:

- Total number of students
![](/Images/totalStudentCount.png)
- Total number of schools
![](/Images/totalSchoolsCount.png)
- Total budget
![](/Images/totalBudget.png)
- Average math score & Average reading score
![](/Images/averageScores.png)
- Percentage of students who passed math & Percentage of students who passed reading
![](/Images/percentagesMathReading.png)
- Overall passing percentage
![](/Images/overallPercentage.png)

Resulting Dataframe District Summary

## Results: ##

Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions.

How is the district summary affected?
